        <h2>Important Heroes</h2>
        <h3><a href="https://onepunchman.fandom.com/wiki/Saitama" target="_blank">Saitama</a></h3>
        <p><img src="images/OK.png" alt="OK">Our beloved bald hero! Saitama's superhuman abillites have caused him to adopt an extremelt lassez-faire attitude towards life. Most things
        generate little to no reaction from him and at times you're wondering if he's even paying attention. The one thing that always catches his eye however is money. Saitama is 
        actually a bit of cheapskate stopping at nothing to hit supermarket sales and regularly exploiting his disciple for free labor and rent money. His hero name is "Caped Baldy"</p>
        <h3><a href="https://onepunchman.fandom.com/wiki/Genos" target="_blank">Genos</a></h3>
        <p><img src="images/Genos.webp" alt="Genos">Genos is a cybernetic humanoid designed by the mysterious Dr. Kuseno. He wasn't always a cyborg, but one day when he was a small child an evil android ravaged his village.
            He hopes to learn how to become a skilled fighter from his master Saitama so that he can avenge his family and his village and stop the murderous android. His hero name is "Demon Cyborg"</p>
        <h3><a href="https://onepunchman.fandom.com/wiki/King" target="_blank">King</a></h3>
        <p><img src="images/King.avif" alt="King">King is known as "The strongest human on Earth." His most recognizable characteristic is the "King Engine," a thundering noise that follows
        King whenever he is powered up and ready to end a fight. What most people don't know is that the King Engine is actually just his heartbeat from his nerves. His hero name is "King"</p>
