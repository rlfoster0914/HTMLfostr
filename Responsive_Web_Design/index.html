                <h2>Paper Mario?</h2>
                <p>Most everyone and their kid brother know who Mario is. What most people don't know of however is his foray into the paper world! On August 11, 2001, Intelligent Systems
                    released a quaint little RPG onto the Nintendo 64. In this game you play as the Mario everyone is familiar with. Instead of running from left to right and grabbing
                    flagpoles however, you embark on an epic adventure across the Mushroom Kingdom meeting a huge cast of characters! So why PAPER Mario? To be honest being paper has 
                    very little to do with how the game plays or even the actual plot! It's mainly just used for a throwaway gag here or there referencing them all being paper. However 
                    the art style serves to give this game a very distinct and memorable look even over twenty years after its release.

                <h3>The Series Continues!</h3>
                <p>Intelligent Systems didn't stop after just one game! The original Paper Mario was met with critical acclaim and was loved by fans. This set the stage for many sequels to expand
                    the series and it's lore! The next one in the series was Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door for the Gamecube. After that the series deviated from it's traditional RPG roots, but 
                    has enjoyed sequels on the Wii, 3DS, Wii U, and the Switch! In fact the most recent installment in the series just came out in July of 2020!
