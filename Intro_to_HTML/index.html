    <p>Many of you have probably heard of or played a Pokemon game. Pokemon is a media giant with games, TV shows, playing cards, and so so much more. Basically if there's a way to
        put a Pikachu on it and monetize it Pokemon's parent company, Game Freak, has found a way to do it. The series started in America in February 1996 when Game Freak released their
        first two games, Pokemon Red and Pokemon Blue. The biggest draw of the series without a doubt is the variety of inventive monsters Game Freak has populated the games with. Players
        of the games can choose between 150 different monsters to build their party with, each with a variety of different stats and moves that ensures no two Pokemon ever feel quite
        the same. This translates to complex and engaging fights whenever two players pit their teams against each other! Here I will lay out how one specific Pokemon (picutred above) named
        Pinsir fared in the metagame of these very first installments in the series! Notice I have said I will only be covering Pinsir's viability concerning the first generation, do
        not come at me with any of this "steel types" this and "stealth rock" that.

        <ul>
            <li>There are fifteen (for now) different "types" that a Pokemon can be, such as Fire-type or Electric-type.</li>
            <li>All Pokemon are either monotype or dual type.</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/pokemon-red-blue-yellow-version/Pokemon_Types" target="_blank">Typings interact with each other by either being "Super-Effective" and dealing double damage, "Not Very Effective" and dealing half, and in some cases having no effect at all!</a></li>
            <li>Pokemon can choose between moves that directly attack the opponent, buff themselves, or inflict statuses on the opponent.</li>
            <li>All Pokemon come with five stats - HP, Attack, Defense, Special, and Speed.</li>
        </ul>

    <p>Pinsir is a monotype Bug Pokemon. Unfortunately this might be the single worst typing in the game, especially for Generation 1! Pretty much the only benefit you get from your
        Pokemon having the bug typing is that you resist damage from Ground-type moves. This is no small boon as Earthquake is one of the most powerful moves that opposing Pokemon can
        throw out to do damage to your team. However this is about the only benefit Pinsir gets from it's typing. Being a bug Pinsir is weak to the litany of Fire, Flying, and Rock
        type attacks throughout the rest of the metagame. This is especially bad when you consider that Fire and Rock are two of the most prominent offensive typings in the game, with
        a wide pool of high-damaging attacks to choose from! In this sense Pinsir becomes a bit of a glass cannon where you're hoping it can at least kill something before it dies itself.
        Luckily Pinsir has been gifted a couple tools to help it accomplish this. One of these tools is Swords Dance, a boosting move that doubles Pinsir already respectable Base 125
        Attack. You may have trouble finding an opportunity to set one up, but once you have it's very unlikely Pinsir is leaving the field without a KO or two under it's vertabrae. 
        Pinsir also has very important move coverage by learning a Fighting-Type move, Submission. Fighting-Type moves are Super-Effective against Normal-Types which are the most prevalent
        typing in Generation 1's metagame. They are also Super-Effective against Rock-Types allowing it to get the jump on would-be counters trying to exploit its weaknesses! All in all 
        Pinsir wasn't exactly a front of the game threat, but if you took it lightly you ran the risk of getting swept by this illustrious insect!
